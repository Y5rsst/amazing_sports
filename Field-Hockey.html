        Hockey has its origins in 18th century England. Over time, different types of hockey developed as people created their own versions of the game. Some well-known examples include field hockey (played on grass or turf), street hockey (played on asphalt or concrete), and roller hockey (played on roller skates).
        
        Ice hockey began in Canada and quickly became the most popular form of hockey in Canada, the U.S., Scandinavian countries, and Eastern Europe. On the other hand, field hockey remains very popular in South Asia, South America, and parts of Central Europe.
        
        Although underappreciated in certain areas, field hockey has a committed fan base of 2 billion people. Field hockey is a popular sport in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia, known for its fast-paced action and technical skill. It also has a prominent presence in the Olympic Games, which strengthens its global significance.
